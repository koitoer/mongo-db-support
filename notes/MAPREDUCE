Mapreduce is slow and should not be used for real time analysis.
Parallel across multiple server and they do the task, finally merge all the pieces.
Will use a map and reduce function written in javascript.

db.runCommand({"mapreduce" :  "collection" , "map" : functionMap, "reduce" : functionReduce})

map, use the emit function emit(key, value)
reduce, is a funtion(key, emits)
input, number of documents sent to the map function
emit, number of times emit was called in the map function
output, number of documents created in the result collection

Other params are 
finalize - final function
keeptemp - maintain unles mongo client dies.
out -  change the name of temporal collection
query - filter
sort - sort
limit - limit.
scope - pass params to the mapreduce functions "scope" : {now : new Date()} 
verbose - get more output of hte process.
